## Learning Journal
### CF401
### Week 2

This last week has been quite tough, to say the least. There's been a few times where Ive felt so defeated I nearly want to give up and just cry my guts out. A weird feeling for me. So yeah, its been stressful. We've been learning a lot about servers and other stuff which doesn't hold my attention a lot. Basically we haven't been doing any frontend stuff, which is what I like. I'm trying my hardest to learn the things but am feeling burned out especially when I look at my grades. Every day I basically hand in broken code and hope to fix it on the weekend or some other time. Each day is hard from a timing perspective because by the time we are done with class and the whiteboarding it is nearly 2PM. And then I have to rewrite the starter code for the lab and then work on what we are doing. So I'm really falling behind in terms of understanding things. I feel similar to how I felt at the end of 301 when I didn't understand very much of what we were doing on a daily basis and felt pretty lost. I'm hoping eventually things will start to click. We had a bitmap assignment last thursday that really wrecked my confidence levels. We were learning binary and other computer science concepts for it that I couldnt understand. Im not sure if I will ever need to have that knowledge besides perhaps an interview. Speaking of interviews, I do really like that we are doing whiteboarding. I was pretty scared though the first time we did it and really struggled to conceptually come up with how to solve the problem. Which I feel like has always been a problem; solving code problems when they involve programming logic. I think so far thats been a big struggle of mine so far in this class which has been so focused on computer science type stuff, is that Im still rewiring my brain to handle it all. In other news last friday a job popped up at a firm I would love to work at, so I applied on monday woohoo! Front end engineer at Subsplash. We shall see what happens... I dont think I'm qualified since they are looking for a mid level but it will probably be good experience. Anyways class has been a different teacher and a different teaching dynamic and since I had nick for both 201 and 301 I'm sure I'm also having to adjust to the new learning style. I think Vinicio is solid and really knows his stuff but I think we need more code reviews and less 'him coding and us watching' in class. I wonder how other 401 classes do it. I know Nick would do a lot of forcing us to tell him what to do but I have a feeling with how much material we are covering that wouldn't be possible in 401. Maybe 401 is too short. Or maybe I should take a community college kinda class after this to stretch my learning.
