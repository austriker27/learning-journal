# LJ Code 201 - Day 4
## Journaling to Learning

Wow. Today was hard. There were so many times when I felt like just walking away from the computer in disgust. I feel like at many times my code logically made sense in my head and it should have worked but it didnt. A few times I would discover that I didnt capitalize a B or something super minor (welcome to software engineering). The assignment sounded easy at first but it turns out objects are really hard to figure out for the first time. A bunch of stayed late at Code Fellows until late past dinner (I left at 930 and there will still 10+ people there then). I finally got my code to work somehow, not sure exactly what I did because I feel numerous times my code mirrored others and theirs worked and mine didn't. Then there were times when my code worked but then it didnt. Argh programming. I finished my code and moved on the end user facing page. I surprised myself with some simple CSS to make it look somewhat pretty and decided to call it a night. Oh wait, its 1015 and I still have some reading to do. Something that did annoy me today was that we only had, at most, 2 TAs available to help. And Nick was mostly busy. When the TAs did show up we all swamped them I think so I didnt hardly any help today and I felt like I was floundering for like 4 hours in the afternoon. I know there's that '15 minute' rule and the problem with it is, there wasnt any help for me to go to after 15 minutes with the TAs and Nick missing (and my classmates stuck in the same spot as me). All well, day 1 of the hardest week is over. So thats good. And my assignment is done. So thats double good. And im satisfied with the appearance of the site. Hope this makes some sort of coherent english sense because my brain hurts and Im exhausted.
