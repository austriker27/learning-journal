# Learning Journal
## CF 401

Argh, another week down. It feels like we are nearing the end which is a nice feeling but a terrifying feeling because I know e have so much more to learn. We've started reactJS lately which is awesome and fun and has so much potential. Its also super confusing with this weird state thing being passed all over. I'm excited to take this knowledge out into the world. Ive also started working on my professional career life by looking around at jobs and companies my network works at and I've found I think I want to be a UI developer. Not sure I can get that job right away but we shall see. I feel like I am way more interested in the design of things than coding of things. That being said Im excited to learn more of react and this whole JS framework thing because its so hot right now. Also I have a bunch of side projects that could surely benefit from website rebuilds in react or a similar framework. Last week I felt super lost but actually today and yesterday some of last week's concepts feel like they might be sinking in. Just gotta keep swimming until and keeping my head above until the end.
