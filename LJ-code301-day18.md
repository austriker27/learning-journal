# Learning Journal - day 16
## Code Fellows 301

Today was fairly frustrating... I thought we would be ready to do some front end build outs by the end of the day but we haven't even finished core functionality yet. That being said we are basically two steps from that so we did accomplish that a lot today. Marco and I spent what seemed like forever trying to get handlebars to work and tried everything under the sun with Luay. He even did exactly what we were doing in a codepen but we couldnt fix it until we talked to Nick. Oh asynch issues. And callback hell. At one point Luah suggested we refactor all our code into a constructor which made sense to us so we went back and tried to figure it out. Later we clarified with him after trying to do it and after explaining how we were obtaining the info from reddit he clarified it wouldnt be a good idea for our code base. So that was fun. Im excited for tomorrow because we can connect the two thing we need to connected and get MVP working. And then we have a few stretch goals and styling to do. Stoked for some styling. I was doing some research on loading animations tonight. I think it would be cool to get a loading animation with the reddit logo shows up and fills up with color until the page is loaded and then it goes bye bye. Also I want to use a new CSS library if we can so I was looking at bulma, materialize css, semantic UI, and milligram as options. So hope tomorrow goes according to plan! I think every day we have hit a road block, so thats been fun.
