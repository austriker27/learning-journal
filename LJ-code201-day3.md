# LJ Code 201 - Day 3
## Journaling to Learning

*Directions:
At the end of the day, write to your heart's content. Write about what you learned, what may or may not have happened in group work, what you're hoping for, etc. This is for your own reflection more than it is just another assessment instrument.*

Today was interesting. I think I spent way too long on experimenting in the wild world of CSS because I didn't get started on the JS stuff in our assignment until 4ish I think. But I really want to get good at CSS and make things looking cool. And CSS makes less logical sense than JS I think so you just have to mess around with it. I really liked the styling of our website today. So that was fun. Debugging JS is kind of a pain but welcome to the software engineer life eh? The lectures today seemed a bit like review and probably could have been shorter in length, at least in my opinion. I really hope we review my code tomorrow because Im pretty sure I did a lot of things wrong, but I think they still work. Just poorly.
