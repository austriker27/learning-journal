So yesterday we learned handlebars templating which seems like it will make life easier but I think it just seemed another something new to learn which is al to on top of everything else. We got it to work in our pair programming and thats good though. We did our lab programming in the afternoon after lecture and that was less stressful than trying to do it in the morning I think. Then this morning I could work on my portfolio which is days behind and fix the pair programming from yesterday with my partner. Im really ready for the weekend because it means we wont have a huge assignment that is due the next day and I can try to catch up on stuff this weekend.
