## Learning Journal

Today we learned how to mess up the github repos beyond all repair. Just kidding, it wasnt beyond all repair but the directions were super confusing, especially as they were written for a group of 4 people and we were 3. I think we spent more time trying to figure out what the instructions were saying than actually fixing the github. That being said I think github is amazing, its such a powerful tool and I dig it for collab projects. The rest of the afternoon we spent some time wireframing and white boarding out our super project which has evolved from a hipster escape text based adventure game into a ghost town text based adventure game. it should be rad. We hashed out a lot of the logic I think today so that was good. We had to be careful to heading down rabbit holes of doing actual code. Max likes to write actual code out rather than psuedo code it seems. We laid out some cool designs and linked up some sweet techie tools (my favorite kind of thing) like waffle, trello and slack.
