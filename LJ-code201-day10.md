# LJ Code 201 - Day 4
## Journaling to Learning

Wow, today was a long day on top of a long week. The last few days have been easier which is nice but not necessarily easy. Thats because monday and tuesday were pretty dang intense. The class structure is really smart because Im pretty sure we would all be feeling pretty down if we had days like monday and tuesday the whole week. My brain still hurts and I feel like we didnt learn that much new stuff the last 2 days. Today we went to 2 presentations from 401 JS classes which was awesome. It was really cool to see how much more knowledge we will know and what we can potentially do with all our learnings. Also I was a bit surprised at how poorly designed some of the projects looked (well, thats specific to the projects that werent at midterm because they had front ends built out) - its a good reminder how much freaking work a really slick web application can take. And they only had a week to bust it out which is pretty insane I would think. So after the really cool projects and pretty good lunch and learn about salary negotiation (I took notes for the future but feel Ill probably forget a lot of the info) we had a partner activity. This was particularly exhausting because its hard to code a website I think with two people. Id much rather do it on my own and ask questions as they come up. but that means its a really good activity in stretching my comfort zone and challenging myself. I was with ozge which added a light language barrier element. Shes super nice and its fun to work with someone from Turkey! Also i cant imagine having to learn how to code in a second language (even her keyboard is in turkish!) so mad props to her. Either way it was fun to dig more into CSS as that helps us get better at it. And like Ive said before I like learning it and feel the best way is to just practice since it doesnt seem super logical like JS. This weekend is gonna be PACKED! I really want to do the extra credit goal of building the bootstrap (boo bootstrap) site by hand but also want to make sure I finish any reworks and get full credit on everything I can. Also I want to see my wife because I know she misses me and we've only been married < 4 weeks which is crazy! We've still got a lot of decorating and such to do in our condo and its not helpful when Im spending 12+ hours a day on CF. All well, it was our decision so we expected as much. Woohooo weekend. Also Im kinda liking the idea of maybe doing a TA thing later after 301 and before 401. I like helping people and teaching and it would be a great way to solidify content.. Hmmmmm
