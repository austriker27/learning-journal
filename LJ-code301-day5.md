# CF 301 - Day 5

Okay, well its been a long long week. It feels like we've going for months (aka 'that code fellows feeling') even though its just been one week. And it feels different than 201 because I feel like Ive learned less. Probably because in 201 we went from 0 to 60 and now we are going from like 60 to 80 but on a curved road. Today we walked through a lot of code review including using jQuery and handlebars together. Woohoo. I was on the hot seat for awhile and it was quite hot. Woohoo learning. Im excited for the weekend because it feels *really* good to not have an assignment due tomorrow (besides stuff thats already assigned) and that means I can refactor my current code aka get it actually working. Tomorrow a bunch of us are meeting up to take on some code wars which should be a good learning experience I think. And sunday I plan on meeting with my partner to finish our pair programming. Im intrigued that next week we will be doing more backend but also wish I could spend more time on learning how to properly css and html stuff and use JS on the frontend to make stuff look pretty. The HTML in my portfolio is kind of a mess because of all the handlebars and jQuery stuff. Creating a structure thats easiest for DOM manipulation via jQuery and such is probably a thing we just need to practice and practice.
