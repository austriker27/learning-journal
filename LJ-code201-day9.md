# LJ Code 201 - Day 4
## Journaling to Learning

Today was awesome. My code worked yesterday, I feel like Im starting to somewhat understand the code. Like I understand the code when we do code review in the morning but the hard part is when I have to write it. But today I figured out some JS stuff all on my own and it was great. The other awesome part about today was working for hours in CSS and HTML and stuff. I dd a bunch of wireframes and website design then built out the salmon cookies site. I made a nav bar and 6 sub sites with their own stylesheets. It was awesome. I definitely dont have a good handle on CSS yet so it was grand to spend some time tinkering around in it. Because I feel like thats how you have to learn CSS because its not as logical in terms of overall flow as JS. So it was really fun. I enjoyed it. The site is looking a lot better. Its not great and is far from the concept in my mind but the design language is consistent throughout the site which is fun. I cant wait to know CSS well enough to be able to style stuff the way it appears in my head.
