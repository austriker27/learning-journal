#LJ Code 201 - Day 2
##Journaling to Learning

*Directions:
At the end of the day, write to your heart's content. Write about what you learned, what may or may not have happened in group work, what you're hoping for, etc. This is for your own reflection more than it is just another assessment instrument.*

Today was good. So far I feel good.  Although my brain hurts, so far most of the material is review so my mind hasn't been totally blown yet. Which makes sense, because it's only day 2. I really like the html and CSS material but struggle with in-depth JS so far. So I'm a bit apprehensive looking towards some heavy JS days in the near future but am stoked to learn more about building websites. I'm excited to learn more about layout and dig deep into the how to of designing a website. All the side project work I've done in html and css in the previous months has helped me understand a lot of the basics around html, css, git and random computer knowledge (like explaining what agile was earlier today).

Today I really enjoyed a collaborative lab environment that a few students and I had as we plowed through some code together. I like helping those around me as I shared a lot of the knowledge I have to share about web dev. Today was a great chance of pace from Day 1 because it was only a half day of lecture and we got a lot of hands on exposure in the afternoon which was nice. Sometimes I get a bit frustrated when questions stray completely off topic or are things that were covered many times in our readings.

I stumped TA Brian today, which was kinda fun. I was working on the `or` part of the `if` statement in my JS file for our about_me page and had `(predictionLower === 'yes' || === 'y') ` in my code after a prompt but no matter what I typed it seemed like the `predictionLower` variable was returning the answer for yes even though `consoleLog` returned what we entered correctly. Turns out this conditional is incorrect and the actual way to write it is : `(predictionLower === 'yes' || predictionLower === 'y')`. *Guess the computer-machine-thing isn't smart to know we wanted the conditional included before and after the `||` statement.* **Yay humans!**

Next up, more complicated JS!
