## CF 401 - week 1
## Learning Journal - learning things 

This week has been rough. By the end of the 301 class I felt pretty lost every day and like I didnt really understand the core concepts we were using. I feel similar to that right now. Also I think I'm realizing that I'm not super interested in the computer science approach we are taking to learning the materials. Or rather not that interested in the computer science things we are learning. I definitely like designing things more and like the frontend world more than the backend. So I guesss I have many weeks to wait until we get to stuff that interests me. Right now I feel like I lack some motivation in this class due to that lack of interest in the material. Also I think its hard when most of the class came from a different cohort than myself so I don't really know anyone. Hopefully we can have some group projects where I can work with the other people and get to know them more. Typically by the time lecture ends and we go out into the study area to work there aren't any seats left besides an occasional single or 2 seats next to each other. This limits the chances of working with my classmates.
