## cf 301 - day 6

today we learned about AJAX and APIs. And IM stoked for all the possibilities it entails. Basically grabbing info from APIs will allow us to build our own super legit websites! I feel like (if I had time) I could build a simple little weather website right now with my skillset. And thats awesome. In other news I finally got my portfolio up to spec (per fridays requirements) and can hand it in. That being said I havent worked on the requirements for today's portfolio nor done the other homework so it seems like another week where my wife wont see me and I wont sleep. Yay. On my project I updated my nav bar from a hover (which only works well on mobile) to an event listener using jQuery, which was so flipping easy with jQuery. And I finally got my portfolio sections to show up based on clicking on the nav bar tab. I spent many hours trying to troubleshoot and got some help today from the excellentest TA, Megan. (she seems brilliant). Turns out I was hiding some parts of the code where the stuff I was trying to get to show up. And thats why it wouldnt show up. I feel like i understood the AJAX and API stuff today more than the stuff last week but as always, Im sure understanding in class will be different than applying to my own projects during lab time. Sidenote, it seems like we are getting more work than is humanly possible lately and if 401 is worse Im not sure how I will keep up.
