# Learning Journal - day 20
## Code Fellows 301

DONE!! WOOHOOO!!!! I liked how we actually planned our presentation this time for the project and I feel like I actually got some talking time with the mic. Which is good because I need practice with that because I dont really like talking in front of people. We have a slight bug in our code and I hope we can fix it so we can show off this beast on our professional portfolios. I need to rebuild my personal (davidalindahl.com) because right now its based off a crappy bootstrap template.. CUSTOM WEBSITE TIME!  I learned I can survive (i will survive... ) for many weeks of brain draining work. Now I can build stuff for realz for my own ideas! Rainierwatch.com rebuilding time! I think I own 10ish domains that I want to rebuild... woohooo!
