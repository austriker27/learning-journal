# CF 301 - Day 10

I think today my learning / confidence level reached an all time low. Usually Ive been able to stay above a 7 or so. But this morning I was at like a 3. Not much we were doing made sense. This morning in the pair programming we had a heckuva time trying to figure out what were doing to refactor everything in the TODOs. The code demo from friday's class wasnt a ton of help and we struggled through it. Im sure we will have lots of rework. Which is not good because it seems like we have more assignments than ever and no time to do them. The code review this morning also seemed short which was not great. Although I think in class I was able to understand a lot of the stuff a bit more than this morning in pair programming. It seemed like it was cut short so we could attend some presentation thing that sounded way over my head. I didnt go, I had too much to do. I got my portfolio assignment back and had a 3/10 because I didnt have time to finish all the tech specs. So I refactored it this afternoon and somehow my IFFE and arrow statements I got correct in only a few tries. Arrrrrghhhhhhh.
