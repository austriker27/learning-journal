## CF 301 - Day 15

We built a thing! Pretty cool to see what we can do in 2 days with everyone pitching in and contributing. On one hand I feel like I havent learned a ton but then I need to intentionally look back and realize how much I've learned. Im super stoked to be finished with 301 and start on all my side project ideas, as I've probably mentioned a few times. Wooohooo learning!
