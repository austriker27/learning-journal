# Learning Journal - day 16
## Code Fellows 301

Today was fairly frustrating. After getting a 69 on the test yesterday and getting frustrated by a lot of the questions seeming like trick questions (one question I even mocked up using an index file and JS file and still got it wrong) and some dumb mistakes I made today didnt help. We struggled the whole day to figure out how to connect to the reddit API. Fortunately by the end of the day we finally got connected and pulled back some data in JSON format. Which is a big success. I'd like to say I think that might be the hardest part of the project but Im scared to think about how we will code the database stuff. I think that sounds tricky and I dont think we have a great grasp on it. This project seems a lot different than 201, I dont think I felt this lost when we did our 201 project. At least as far as I remember... It seems like we all are struggling a lot more with what we learned in 301 and how to apply it versus 201. But I guess thats the nature of the stack learning and it goes to show what we've learned is pretty advanced. The meetup tonight at least was interesting. I talked to a UX designer from Avvo who wants to learn coding (the opposite of me! I want to learn UX design) and that was awesome. He showed me some of the mockups and such that he built. I still think that UX and UI design is where I want to be in 5ish years!
