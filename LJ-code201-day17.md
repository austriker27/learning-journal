Today we worked on the logic, building out the game component of the game. It involved a lot of pair programming between the 3 of us as we had to figure out how to get various messages to display at various times for the various encounters and enemies. Also I had a cool break through with the audio player that pauses the audio upon user request as to not piss off everyone who visits the site. Yesterday I couldnt get the button to pause the music without a double click but today I was able to fix the button so it showed a pause button which allowed me to autoplay the music. Also today had another cool breakthrough on the CSS styling for the user input box which allowed the box to slide into the screen. (It was being created in JS and so I added a tag via JS which had CSS on it). We did a lot of good work today and hit MVP this afternoon! Woohoo! Our game technically works a lot although a lot of the text is missing so it doesnt make much sense. But we got it working and that feels great! Its also a pretty deep game with 2 environmental encounters and 3 encounters with bosses and a lot of the logic is built so a user cant figure out how to win easily. We did that with randomizers for skills and a lot of other behind the scenes black magic.
