### Week 3

Wow, time has been flying by. Crazy to think after next week we start projects. AND THEN WE GET TO DO THE FRONT END! I cant flipping wait. So far the class has slowly been getting better for me, but Im seriously worried I might not pass. My intrest level has gone up the last few days as we have started databases stuff because it feels way more useful to me than learning the computer science concepts that while I probably need for an interview, arent interesting to me nor seem useful in teh long run. I still routinely feel lost and am getting my butt kicked by whiteboarding. Which I am glad we are doing daily because I definitely need practice. Last week we had another huge lab that took all my time. Im hoping our load will go down a bit so I can have time to practice whiteboarding or developing soft skills like resume building, networking and the like.
