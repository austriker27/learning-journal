Today was day one of project week! Woohoo! And shayne created a masterpiece of drawings and animations. His asets look fantastic. Our game, Ghostown, is really coming along. I was slightly worried about the logic but I think we made so progress today I dont have many worries left. Basically its a choose your own ghost text based adventure. I built a cool little music player today so we dont annoy all our users with music in the background you cant mute. Also it was hard to keep up with Max as he dominated a ton of JS logic for the battles and encounters but I helped out where I could. I think our group is really well diversified. I felt like today I didnt help as much as the other guys but shayne reassured me I did a lot of great work which included setting up super helpful tools for us to use. Like slack integrations from our trello board and the github repo (i love web dev tools!). I must admit having slack integrations when something is updated on github is pretty aweosme.  Our projects looks fantastic and we are going to include some math formulas to keep players from being to master the game in just a few turns. Im stoked to be able to put it in a web dev portfolio! Woohoo group projects.
