## Learning Journal

Today we presented our project, our game Ghostown. And it was fun to reveal the finished product that is very polished and clean without any real bugs. Of course we had a few stretch goals left to hit but time is limited of course. I got our site deployed today to a real webpage which was neat to show off. I struggled for awhile to learn SSH and then asked TA james about SSH and he said for a website like this just use FTP (which I know). So after spending over an hour trying to learn SSH because Nick in class said SSH is way better I ended up just doing an SFTP which was easy to setup as Im familiar with it. Soooo yeah otherwise it was a fun to present even though I was pretty nervous beforehand and felt we werent as prepared as we could have been to talk. But I think our product spoke for itself.
