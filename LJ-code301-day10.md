Awwwwwww brain. Im pretty thankful there's this thing called a weekend where I can spend 2 days finishing the insane amounts of work due for monday. I feel like Im on this rollercoast (called code fellows) where one day I think I get most of the stuff enough to keep my mouth above water and breathing and then the next day Im dumped on again. You would think I'd be used to this type of thing by now but I guess not.  Today was rough, I feel like yesterday I was sort of getting all the routes and stuff figured out then today in lab we just couldnt figure anything out. And Im back to being stressed out at the amounts of homework we have to do by monday and how little progress we made in 2 hours on our lab assignment this afternoon. Once again I think I can follow the code demos and code reviews in class somewhat well but then its a different story when I get out into the world of lab. Maybe its because I understand the concepts just well enough to track them in class but not well enough to write them on my own. All the functions (and methods?) like .map we learned today seem super useful, I think I just need processing time for my brain to comprehend all the routes and such. Finishing the lab this morning with Kinley was interesting because they seemed quite uneasy at not totally getting everything whereas I think Im more okay when I dont understand something. Nicks comments in yesterdays learning journal were reassuring, sometimes I wonder how it must feel to be Zeus and watch us all go from knowing nothing about code to learning how to write some APIs. Sidenote I definitely want to watch the 401 final JS presentations this weekend, I forgot to watch them last time they presented and I love seeing new app ideas and new UIs. also sidenote I was so jazzed about the lunch and learn today that I even twitter about it but sadly it let me down. While there was some slightly interesting info in the presentation it seemed more about the 2 people pushing their company and product. I couldnt help but think they didnt know their audience all that well (are a bunch of poor students who dished out a ton of money for CF really going to spend $300 to $400 on a one day seminar?). That being said I liked their card deck and actually might buy one because it seemed to have a lot of good info. Further sidenote, Im going to apply to be a TA this weekend. I was going to do it last night but I dont have an up to date resume that I deem worthy to be submitted so I have to tweak it this weekend. Ive gone back and forth about TA-ing mostly because I want to take the time between 301 and 401 to work on my numerous side projects and finish things like moving out of my friends house into our condo and organizing the condo we just moved into before I started CF. But I love teaching people and it will help to reinforce my knowledge. I dont think I could handle a 301 class though, so hopefully just a 201 or 101/102. Thats all, *huge* journal today. (okay, one last sidenote, have I mentioned I like to write, especially creatively and thats another reason Im chasing this web dev thang).
