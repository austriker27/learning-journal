# Learning Journal

## Day 11 aka the day I thought it would be easier but I got stumped and stayed until 10pm

Today I thought would be easier, after all we were past the week everyone talks about as being super hard. And it was super hard. Those concepts were hard to understand. That being said while my head didnt hurt as much today as last week I didnt get the lab solved by night end. And I feel like I didnt get that far really. I got stuck on trying to get the event listeners (which were listening correctly per my tests) to tell which images they were listening to. Like I couldnt figure out how to get the event listeners to link up with which items were displayed in the div. I used the inspector and looked through the event target and tried a bunch of stuff.  Some people were doing a bunch of conditions and for loops but I think it should work better if the event listener and function was in the constructor. But. it. just. wont. work. Not cool javascript. Its frustrating because only 5 of us were left past 6pm and I dont want to be left behind not getting a solution on this lab.

This is all a stark contrast from yesterday when I spent a solid 7 hours on the bootstrap homework. I really really enjoyed building that site even though it was a long process with lots of trial and error and learning in CSS. I think maybe because the output was a 'tangible' or visual product that I built led me to liking it so much. I always kinda figured I would like the design aspect (because I love design in general) a lot in web dev so that just confirms my suspicions. Im excited to design and build more webpages now that I actually know what Im doing in coding (somewhat) and am not stumbling around blindly. Also my brother says "PHP is not dead (it was dying in 2010) because laravel is reviving it".... Let the back end wars begin!
