## Learning Journal - 301 - Day 1

Wow. That came fast, class I mean. It seems like just yesterday we were here. Of course I had intentions to do studying and practice last week but then life got the better of me and I only did the bare minimum. Today was rough I think as my brain was not used to code and stuff. I think a lot of us are in that same boat as I write this its 7pm and we've got a handful of us still here. The portfolio project today seemed pretty time intensive in terms of what we had to accomplish today. Today I added a hamburger menu to my site that disappears when the screen size is over 800px and adds 2 menu items to the nav bar upon mouse click via event listeners. However the items dont get removed and when you click on the burger menu multiple times you get a bunch of menus. The rest of the page looks pretty terrible and while Ive built a constructor its not working properly and there's a lot left in the project to finish. But Ive got the base of it built I think and I need to move on to the rest of the assignments so I can actually get home at a reasonable hour. I hope the buses are still running, sidenote. Also it sounds like this portfolio project is on going over 3 weeks although it seems like we have a lot to do it today. Im glad we are building it because it seems pretty crucial to our new careers and my prior online portfolio is pretty crappy and built off a bootstrap template [here](http://davidalindahl.com). I think I spent a lot of time today looking for design inspirations on various sites and found some amazing examples out there. Then I found an online tool to wireframe for free (most places make you pay it seems and Im not doing that in gimp), called wireframe.cc. Woohoo website planning (some of my favorite things).
