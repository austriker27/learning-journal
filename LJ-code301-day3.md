## CF 301 - Day 3

Today Marco and I pair programmed on something this morning that feels like a million years ago. I remember we had a lot of issues with it and it took us pretty close to the deadline before we finished. Then of course we got another assignment tonight using jQuery that sounded easy based on what we did in class but now after spending a few hours on it I cant get mine exactly to work like the tech specs. I dont like the tech specs of making all the sections disappear while the section you clicked on only shows. I did get the scrolling to work. And that good enough for now. I havent had time to do the readings and probably wont have time tonight. I still have to do the codwars, and if prior times are any examples, it will take me over an hour to complete it. I hope the days start to lessen up because at this rate Im not going to have much brainpower left. I dont think I was ready for how intense 301 starts, especially after the soft start of 201. Maybe its just because coding has completely fried my brain. I dont have a passing grade right now and only just today got my constructor to render correctly to the DOM after help from a TA, so that means I have mondays assignment completed, maybe even yesterdays. Constantly being behind several days sucks and is hard because I felt good after keeping my head up for most of 201 but now Im struggling a lot to stay alive.
