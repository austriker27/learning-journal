# CF 301 - Day 10

I feel like the last few days have been so confusing with all the routing that I hardly understand much of what we are doing. Somehow Rob and I completed our assignment this morning, proving 0.5 + 0.5 equals 2. But now I have to apply the same type of coding to my portfolio which is still a work in progress to meet the day 10 specs. Seems crazy there's only a 3 more days of class before project week. Im stoked for our project ideas, I think we have two great ideas and one good idea. I cant decide between the fun option (Game of Thrones relationship map) and useful option (the word analyzer idea via marco, which could be highly useful for market research and marketing firms).
