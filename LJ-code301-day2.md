## Learning Journal - Code 301 - Day 2

Today was the first day of the backwards schedule (still not sure how I feel about having lectures in the afternoon and pair programming in the morning). Gabe and I did the pair programming in the morning which feels like a millennium ago. We finished it early which was good because the code wars problem was kicking my butt and I didnt finish it yesterday. We learned some stuff that I cant honestly remember but it was all pretty straight forward which was nice. Im still probably a bigger fan of coding solo in general so pair programming will take some adjustment time, as i know it has valuable insights to be shared from doing it. After class, which was hard to do in the afternoon, we had an assignment on our portfolio assignment. I spent most of that time fixing mine because it still wasnt meeting spec for yesterday. My constructor function for my projects wasnt working and I wasnt really grasping all the code for it. I feel dumb because it seems we learned a lot in 201 and now i feel I should be doing better in class instead of floundering and feeling like I cant figure out any of the code we are doing. Guess thats stack learning for you. It seems with our current setup of class in the afternoon we have less time to work on things, which I guess is partially because we have so much more work to do. Im focusing on my portfolio on getting the logic down and making it work even though Id like to spend some time on the CSS and layout so its not crap.
