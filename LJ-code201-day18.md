## Learning Journal

Today we built out more of the game we are working on, Ghostown! Which included fixing and cleaning up a lot of the JS logic and game logic. We are going to hit some awesome stretch goals like including an HP counter and the ability for the enemies to hit back. Also I worked on the about us page and finally got to a presentable state. And we squashed a lot of bugs and even tested the site on the projector (which thanks to great color calibration settings on the monitor, caused more fixes to be made to the about us page). The game looks amazing and we added animations for the characters and enemies. Shayne drew a bunch of them today and we've added them into the site. Our game has tons of potential and I think all of us see it as more than just a project but an actual game thats totally playable and addictive.
