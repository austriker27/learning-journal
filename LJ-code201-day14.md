# Learning Journal

Today was practice, we implemented an order form that was part of the bus mall project. Using local storage we linked the customer's orders to be filled into a cart. The customers could then remove the items from the cart. We used JS to create a table of items in the cart and even listeners to remove them when the customer clicked delete. It was a pair programming and we had 3 people so that caused a bit of tricky around organizing who did what and how to work on branches and do PRs but after a few minutes of working out those details we were fine. I think our group for the project next week (this is who we worked with today) is pretty solid. Max can sometimes super get into things and leaves me behind but thats okay. Im excited to learn more about the logic of stuff from him and learn design thinking from shayne.
