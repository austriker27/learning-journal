# CF 301 - Day 9

Holy crap wow. Today was intense. It felt like the whole CF experience condensed into one day. Basically just had our minds blown all day long. Right away I thought we were in big trouble because Nick, in a very loud and stern voice (really thats just his normal voice), ordered us all, without explanation, into a classroom right at like 9am. Luckily (or unluckily) we were just deviating from the normal schedule and spending the morning in lecture review. We walked through connecting the back side and front side and while Im tempted to say it was the most helpful thing ever, I'd say it was quite helpful but still feel uneasy about things. I think its just going to take lots of practice writing get and post routes (etc). It was very satisfying and cool to see how fast we were able to construct a real website that actually does stuff. Like not just a static landing page but a functional webpage that saves stuff and does all sorts of stuff with inputs and the like! Woohoo! I dont know how to describe it but that mind blowing realization of 'this is the real web crap stuff' was pretty cool. WE ARE DEVELOPERS! BUILDING THE THINGS! That being said towards the end of it I was definitely suffering from code fatigue and was having trouble concentrating. My brain felt like it was just giving up and refusing to recognize any more code. So kinley and finished yesterday's assignment and called it a day on our pair programming. On a side note I feel like these codewars programs are a real shot to my confidence levels. I struggle with every single of them, spend hours and hours pouring over them and cant get them (the last one I got a 0 because I didnt submit anything). And its hard because I feel like I need to find an answer for them by the due date otherwise I get a zero, and those zeros could add up fast. This morning Kinley looked at the array possibilities one and figured out a solution in like 10 minutes. I still cant figure it out, and ive spent probably 2 hours looking at it. I know its a dangerous game to compare myself but its hard for me not to. I feel like the programming side of my brain just doesnt work that well, which I guess makes sense because I find myself more intrigued by the design aspect. I guess I Just dont have the special ingredients in my brain to logically think through programming problems. Which scares me because it seems important for a: class and b: finding a job / interviews.
