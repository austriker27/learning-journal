# Learning Journal - day 16
## Code Fellows 301

Wow, I felt so low after that test and feeling like I didnt know anything it was great to see Nick sort of struggle with a lot of the test questions today in the review. And it was reassuring to hear him comment on how poorly worded some of the questions were that confused us. Our project was a slog. We pair programmed again today, Max and I setup some SQL and wrote some routes and such that would save our reddit info into the SQL. Mike and Marco fought the good fight against this language processor API we are trying to use. Eventually they finally won after numerous hours with the TAs and even Nick. We had a lot of ambitious goals for today and I think we suceeded on meeting nearly all of them except Max and I couldnt get handlebars js to render the subbreddit names to our page for some reason. Im excited because I think we are over the hard stuff and on to the fun stuff of styling and actually writing code. I feel like the last two days we havent written much code on a lines of code per minute basis. Which is such a difference from the 201 project to now.
