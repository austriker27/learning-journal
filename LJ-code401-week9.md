We are finishing up React which is crazy crazy! Hard to believe my time at code fellows is coming to an end. Its been quite the ride. I should definitely look back at where I started because sometimes I can defeated by coding. Especially all the data structure stuff we are doing. Im definitely loving the frontend stuff! Although react is still pretty tricky. Im excited for our final project because I feel like I finally get to build something I want to do and put everything we've been learning into practice! React is super powerful and Im excited to use it! Also styling and design! woohooO!
