# Learning Journal

## CF301 - Day 13

Today I learned if you use single quotes on your commit message you can use the '!'. THIS IS GROUND BREAKING! My commit messages are about to get way more excited. Rob and I somehow got the pair programming this morning, nearly on the first try. That was crazy because we stumbled our way through it. At one point we wrote a method and just threw down some ideas, then went to the TA and learned apparently we did it right. That felt odd. Also its weird how in class when Nick explains all the routing and middleware and communication between server side and client side it makes sense but then when I try it on my own I feel so lost. My portfolio is a mess. Sidenote I got good feedback from Shayne today, apparently I'm super good at finding tools and resources for everything. He said he noticed I have a knack for finding stuff. Time to add 'tool wizard' to the resume!
