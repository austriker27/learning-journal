Today seemed like it was going to be easier than yesterday. I dont understand how when Nick does stuff in class I think to myself 'oh yeah, that seems logical. I can do that' and then when I try it in lab none of my code works. Its 8PM and my brain feels like.. well its even too tired to think of a good simile. Definitely havent finished the assignment and probably wont, which sucks because I dont want to fall behind. I tried to rebuild my code from yesterday to make it better like we did in the class demo today and it kept failing. It took me until 5PM to get my constructor actually working which is annoying I wasted so much time on that. I think I regret that decision to make it better.

Thats all for now.
