# LJ Code 201 - Day 4
## Journaling to Learning

*Directions:
At the end of the day, write to your heart's content. Write about what you learned, what may or may not have happened in group work, what you're hoping for, etc. This is for your own reflection more than it is just another assessment instrument.*

Today was learning in pairs, which I was a bit apprehensive about before we starting going. Sometimes I struggle with giving up control and I can see myself struggling with giving up control over coding. But it went really well. It was very helpful to work together to learn from each other's skills and knowledge. I would even say it was the best lab so far because of this psuedo-forced collaborative coding environment. We had CSS and function time in the morning lecture session; I still really like the CSS stuff so covering layout is interesting. Sadly Nick did not choose my code for review this morning (booo Nick! jk I didnt raise my hand at all.) Im hoping I can get my linter fixed tomorrow because holy cow it seems like it makes JS way easier to code (Mike had it running on his atom).
