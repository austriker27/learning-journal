Today was a long, hard battle but I think we have a great product to show for our week. I started off the day worried we had bit off more than we could chew because we had a lot of goals and while our code worked on wednesday as an MVP we had changed it much since then and there were broken pieces. Im actually surprised more stuff didnt break while we pounded out a few additional features today. We had some issues but nothing major. We added all the story elements to game, finished the about us page, got it deployed to GH pages (after many issues... I just ended up deleting the prior gh pages branch and replacing it with a new one) and had the game playtested by other groups. We got some good feedback and will work in those elements. I also bought the domain for the game and plan on deploying it either tonight (if the DNS propogates in time, it probably wont) or this weekend because this game deserves its own domain (plus we can then track usage with G-analytics better that way).
