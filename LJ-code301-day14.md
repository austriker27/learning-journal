# CF 301 - Day 14

Whoa, project week is nearly here! Its crazy how fast time has flown by. We are gravitating towards the trending word tool which I think could be cool. Plus I think its helpful to have a more academic, tool sort of thing in my portfolio to supplement the game thats also in there. Today we walked through building a SPA that uses an API from scratch which was helpful. Also having the code base as a reference point will be super useful next week and beyond. I cant wait for class to be over so I can work on all the side projects Ive got cooking. Plus I want to get more into logo design and graphic design. I wish the whole industry would really push for more females in coding, and more diversity. I know its a harder issue than just 'hire more diversity' but its annoying how white and especially how male it is. Hopefully that can be something I can work towards as I progress in my career. Also annoying is how confusing and how much paperwork doing the whole unemployment benefits thing is. Apparently if Im on unemployment the government will pay a good chunk of code fellows so I filed last sunday but now have to apply to 3 jobs a week until the retraining exception thing kicks in. Who knows how long the government will take reviewing that. I hate the idea of just applying to jobs that are throw away jobs to meet a number. Its annoying for me and annoying for the firm I apply to (probably like Aon or Boeing or something). I think I want to start doing a lot more code wars stuff because they are so challenging and hard for me it would be good to do. Once I fix my super broken portfolio.
