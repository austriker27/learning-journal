So today our assignment was to add a chart using chartjs and canvas to our prior lab. I spent most of the time trying to fix my code from yesterday. And I finally got it to work. At one point I had 4+ TAs trying to debug an issue that no one could figure out which had to do with my event listeners seemingly not working. Turns out you probably shouldnt name a variable and a function the same name! ha. Won't make that mistake again. So finally at the end of lab time today on campus I got to work on the charts. It was easier to get a chart into the site than it is to get the data to feed. I am headed home on the bus right now so I can actually see my wife so I didnt finish it before I left campus. I'll try to finish it tonight amongst everything else we need to do. I have had a headache the last two days and I think its a residual code-ache from early last week. It sounds like we are working on UI and CSS stuff later this week though, so Im stoked for that. And hopefully I can leave at a reasonable hour to spend time at home with the wifey. The session this afternoon with the teachers for each 401 course was interesting although a bit long as I would have liked to be working on my code. Im sort of tempted by the android route especially after the teacher said they do a lot more design type stuff compared to other courses. But I think Ill probably stick to my original plan of web development as I think that might be easier to do the freelance gig (which Im considering at my brother's LLC).
