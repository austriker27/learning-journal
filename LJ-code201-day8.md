#Learning Journal

Today was a actually not that bad, well compared to the days of yesterday and monday. Which is odd because during class my head hurt the whole time as we tried to swallow event, forms, and all the other goodies. I almost feel like I did something wrong or didnt get the material at all but my code works! _Sidenote I found monty python and seinfeld ipsum generators so my web dev life is a bit more complete. Breaking News- Did you know Frankenstein was not the name of the monster but rather the name of the creator?_ Okay, back to the journal. I would say today, I understood less than I understood yesterday and monday but for some reason my code actually worked today. Maybe thats called learning because yesterday I could have swore I had my constructor set up correctly but it didnt work. It feels so good to have the project finished by 6pm and not 9pm. And now I can examine my code and try to refactor and also style the pages so they look somewhat presentable. What a good feeling. Also the schedule for the next few days sounds interesting. Woohoo for (hopefully) being done with the craziest freaking days so far, and hopefully the hardest part of 201.
